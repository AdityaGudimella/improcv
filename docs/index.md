# Image Processing and Computer Vision

## Introduction

I'm learning about image processing and computer vision. I want to create a resource for
myself and others to learn about these topics. This repository will contain my notes and
code as I learn. I hope that it reads like a book.

## The "Book"

Read the book [here](https://adityagudimella.github.io/improcv/)

## The code

Each chapter has a corresponding folder in the `code` directory. The code is written in
Python. The code is written in Jupyter notebooks. You can install the dependencies using
`poetry install` from the root directory of the repository or by running `pip install .`.
